Hello, I am Wooseong Choi, an undergraduate student in the Department of IT Information Engineering at Jeonbuk National University. I find great joy in the process of learning and mastering new languages and technologies like JavaScript and React, and through this, I have a deep interest in the field of front-end development, which focuses on providing better user experiences.
