For a personal project, I decided to create a 2D side-scrolling action game based on my favorite anime, 'Naruto,' using Java. I studied the basic structure by referencing an existing 2D game source code on GitHub, but I focused on implementing new features by adding my own ideas.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

-   **Multiple Playable Characters**: Freely switch between various characters like Naruto and Sasuke during gameplay.
-   **Item System**: Acquire items with various effects, such as health recovery and attack power boosts.
-   **Score and Life System**: Implemented the classic fun of earning points by defeating enemies and challenging stages with a limited number of lives.
-   **Unique Boss Monsters**: At the end of each stage, a powerful boss with multi-phase attack patterns appears.

It was fascinating to implement everything from graphics rendering to keyboard input and collision detection using only pure **Java**, without any external game engines. I especially enjoyed the process of designing various game elements like characters, items, and enemies in an object-oriented way and expanding them with diverse features.
