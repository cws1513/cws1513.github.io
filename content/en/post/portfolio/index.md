The website you are currently viewing is my third project. Using the static site generator (SSG) **Hugo** and the **Blox** framework, I experienced the entire process of building and deploying my own online portfolio from scratch.

## 🚀 Key Technologies Used

-   **Hugo & Blox Framework**: Used for fast and flexible static site generation. I learned how web pages are automatically created from content written in Markdown.
-   **Visual Studio Code**: Utilized as the main editor for all code modifications and content creation.
-   **Git & GitHub**: Systematically managed all changes using commands like `git add`, `commit`, and `push` in a terminal environment.
-   **GitHub Pages**: Deployed the completed website for free by linking it to a GitHub repository, making it accessible from anywhere in the world.

## 🛠️ Process and What I Learned

Through this project, I was able to experience the overall development workflow beyond just creating a website. I developed problem-solving skills while understanding the template structure and customizing the site by modifying YAML configuration files.

In particular, it was a valuable experience to learn the basic concepts of version control and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) by managing the source code directly with **Git commands** in the terminal and watching the site automatically build and deploy through GitHub Actions.
